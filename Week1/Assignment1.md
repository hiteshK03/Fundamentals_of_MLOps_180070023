## Part 1
1. AIOps combines big data and machine learning achieving increased efficiency in IT operations by automating processes like event correlation, anomaly detection, and causality determination.  
In short ML is just a part of AIOps in its overall flow whereas MLOps is a way to manage and streamline the building, deployment and maintenance of the algorithms.

2. For a linear regression model to be interpretable, it needs to meet certain assumptions such as linearity, normality, independence, fixed features, etc. Interpreting linear model is easy as all we have to do is interpret the weights in the model for different types of features, for eg. while interpreting a numerical feature, an increase in a value of a feature increases the prediction by its weight units, while keeping other feature values same.
